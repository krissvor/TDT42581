    TODO enable and set up the timer

    

    1. Enable clock to timer by setting bit 6 in CMU_HFPERCLKEN0

    2. Write the period to register TIMER1_TOP

    3. Enable timer interrupt generation by writing 1 to TIMER1_IEN

    4. Start the timer by writing 1 to TIMER1_CMD

    

    This will cause a timer interrupt to be generated every (period) cycles. Remember to configure the NVIC as well, otherwise the interrupt handler will not be invoked.
